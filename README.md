# ✨ MiniatureHCF ✨
A Minecraft 1.8.8 HCF Core written in our private, ease of use library plugin inspired by MassiveCore. This will be updated and constructed in time, on any schedule. Really just to look at at the moment, may be released in the future.

# ❓ Info/Pictures ❓

1. The library plugin by no means uses "practical" java when using annotations for commands, it's purpose is simplicity in development to cut time in making plugins.
2. All configuration classes AND command classes are loadad dynamically by the library plugin, you don't need to register or deregister anything yourself.
3. Pagination for command help and other things is already done for you.
